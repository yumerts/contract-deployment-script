# Contract Deployment Script

> A convenient deployment script for this and this project only

```
--endpoint-url <- the endpoint
--priv-key-path <- the path of the private key
--match-i-c <- match info smart contract
--player-i-c <- player information contract
--prediction-c <- prediction contract
```

Just call the sh file and it will do the magic in the background and help with connecting different parts
